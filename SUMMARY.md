**BBBC041Seg: Automatic Segmentation Of Blood Cells From Microscopic Slides** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the medical industry and biomedical research. 

The dataset consists of 1328 images with 93539 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*blood_cell*).

Images in the BBBC041Seg dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (1169 images) and *test* (159 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">North South University</span>, <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Concordia University</span>, and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology</span>.
